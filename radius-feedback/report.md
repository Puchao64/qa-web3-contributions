## 🧪 UX Testing Notes

Overall, the Galxe quest interface was smooth. However, there were **minor delays** when verifying Twitter tasks (follow, like, retweet).  
Had to click the verify button multiple times for some steps to register.  
Also, **quiz questions were clear**, but some links in the reading material didn’t open in a new tab.
